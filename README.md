# Enernet-Diesel-Generator-Replacement-Settings
### Recent product feature update in Ampd

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
I recently led the charge on developing and launching a new feature called Diesel Generator Replacement Settings on Enernet platform. Enernet is an online platform that monitors various device data like input current, output current, maximum temperature, state of charge (SOC), load and carbon saving etc. The core device on Enernet is the Enertainer, which is a battery energy storage system (BESS) mainly designed for the construction industry by Ampd Energy.

This feature tackles the need for more flexible carbon calculations when swapping out diesel generators (DG) with different Enertainer models. Previously, the platform used fixed assumptions for these swaps, which did not fit with most customers' real-world use cases. For example, one assumption was that "1 Enertainer L size replaces 2 x 270kVA DG," which did not reflect actual usage scenarios.

The goal of this feature is to let users pick the right diesel generator model, quantity, and usage period for replacements. Users can see updated carbon and diesel values after editing these settings, so that they can get the best saving estimates for their specific site conditions. This flexibility is important for accurate ESG reporting.
